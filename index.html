<h1>BDG ruleset C-101A</h1>
<p>This is an unofficial set of BDG rules, This means that users may refer to these rules to help an argument but in the end Broadcaster BDG will have the final say (For the rest of the document BDG’s members will be referred to BDG team, This includes: Moderators, Editors, Broadcasters, and Admins. This includes each from both Twitch.tv and Discord.com. BDG the broadcaster will just be referred to as BDG and Wafflefox42 will be referred to as Artist) When stating each article please append the following text with the article “BDG and the BDG team”.  Definitions will be marked as follows: A-[Clause]-D. The version number can be decoded like this (For this demonstration I will use Code C-204A as it is the code I have set while writing this.) C-204A. C- stands for Code which is what I use to refer to these. 204 refers to the version number. This can be decoded like this: 20. This means that there are 2 0’s like this 0.0 then the 4 means that on the end is a 4 so 0.0.4. Now the A refers to the sheet that this is. If you find that this letter is a B it will be a completely different document. Please note Lizard Legal is not a real legal firm and cannot be contacted nor can help with any professional matters, if you would like to ask about this document feel free to ask me (Twitch: @Lizardstogo Discord: @Lizardstogo).</p>
